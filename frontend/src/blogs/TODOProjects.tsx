                <p><b>Maze generation | in progress</b></p>
                <p>Following is the algorithm: </p>
                <p>Step 1: forming an initial maze:</p>
                <p>First, form an n x n square. for i in n, generate a branch at a rate of alpha ~= 0.5, then the branch can uniformly choose one of each:
                they continue straight, or turn right, or turn left. If they reach a point where moving to that direction would have "touched" 
                another branch, they will proceed moving and "block" the pathway if it won't cause a rectangle formed by the branches of any shape to appear. 
                then they stop growing. edges are considered branches. branches will grow from other branches. this step stops when no branch is still growing.</p>
                <p>Step 2: search for path:</p>
                <p>Pick an entrance. from that entrance, perform BFS. For the first search path that reached an edge and both side of the pathway
                is blocked by branches of at least length 1, open the edge in front of the path. if one entrance doesn't work, try randomly 
                another one</p>
