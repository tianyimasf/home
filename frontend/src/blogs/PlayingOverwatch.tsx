                <p>I play some video games. I'm not the biggest gamer out there -- I don't play a lot of different video games, I only play a few
                    games, and overwatch has been there since around 2016, when I first installed a virtual windows machine on my mac just so that
                    I can play overwatch. I remember freshmen year, one of my high school friend came from Syracuse to Rochester to see me, and we
                    played overwatch. I just started playing (although I've been watching other people streaming it for a few years), and I told him 
                    that I get spooked a lot because things happens so fast and so sudden sometimes. He responded that you'll get used to it after
                    awhile. I don't know why, but I remember this verbal exchange vividly. We were sitting in my university's library, and we were
                    trying to play overwatch together.
                </p>
                <p>Playing overwatch can also be lonely sometimes, if you are playing alone. I remember playing it during freshmen summer and sophomore 
                    years, whenever I was not studying. I spent hours and hours on it, sometimes staying up all night. It was the freedom that I never
                    had when I was in high school, living with my mom. I didn't go back to China during the summers and did research, so I had a lot of 
                    free time. I also didn't have to worry about money. So I just played games. Looking back, I could have done something better with my
                    time, but I was ok. I did go hiking and cycling with some PhD friends who are much older than I am, so it's not all bad. We get along 
                    because we are all nerds (lol)</p>
                <p>I was back in China for a leave of absence for a year during my third year in college. I still played overwatch, much with my mom's 
                    complaint. Back then in overwatch you have a team-advertising board where you either join a team or try to form a team. Interestingly and
                    creatively, some people in the Chinese server use it to play music. It will say explicitly in the team name that they are only playing 
                    musics, and if you join in the team voice chat the team leader will play musics. It is through one of these music groups that I met two 
                    people, a brilliant pianist who plays piano for us, and a regular who is in the same city as I was. Almost everyday, the pianist's team
                    ads will appear on the board with the same name, and me and the regular would click in and listen to him play the piano. Sometimes the map 
                    has a piano in it, and we would play it by shooting at it (lol). The regular is a student in our city's film school, and we would chat about 
                    random things. At some point, we started to play GTA online together too. Just before I went back to the states, we went to a Japanese hotpot
                    place in the city and had dinner together. We still talk in VR Chat from time to time nowadays. 
                </p>
                <p>I quited play overwatch for nearly 2 years after I get back to the states. I felt that it took too much of my time and I get suck into it, which 
                    is a feeling that I didn't like. Around the end of 2022, I started traveling with some of my friends, and was talking to who would be my current partner
                    online. Overwatch becomes our common interests and online activity. We would play during the afternoon, and watch something afterwards. Later, we started 
                    play another co-op game called It Takes Two, and had a lot of good memories that I'm fond of. It was a lot of fun. Later I went to see him, and we still
                    played overwatch everyday, with his best friend. Until now, we still play it daily, with his brother and buddy. The crowd just grew bigger and bigger. 
                    It is a comfort activity that we all like to do together. 
                </p>
                <p>My experience playing overwatch changed too. Overwatch is a team game, and I used to constantly try to compensate for my teammates. It was very exhausting.
                    Recently, though, I've became more and more relaxed and just having fun when playing it. I used to get really hyper and restless after playing overwatch,
                    now I can calmly write a journal/read after playing it. Still, I limit the number of games I play, and I try to play other games too.

                <p>All and all, I'm ok with playing overwatch now. I wish I spent time doing more productive stuff, especially back when I was in freshmen and was just playing it by
                    myself. But right now it was a fun group activity that I do, and I get to hang out with people and have fun. Looking back, it has brought me surprising
                    connections, and fun memories. Playing for hours by myself is quite an experience too. It has been in my life for so long that it carries weights now. It's 
                    such an interesting way that games and hobbies can play a part in our lives, bring us together and storing memories. Now overwtach 2 is coming out and overwatch 1
                    will not be around anymore, I'm looking forward to play overwatch 2 with friends again. Anyway, glhf gamers!
