              Listening to a Rock song mix spotify playlist, in contrast to the
              intense beats, I felt heartwarming, and am writing this end of
              year 2022 blog. I want to be really honest writing this. But my
              memory is short-term, so I'll do my best.

              It was Dec 16th, 2021. I just finished the final for my last
              course to finish my math degree. I did an interview for a startup
              in San Francisco a couple days ago, and was waiting for an answer.
              A guy was texting with me just starting a week ago, on reddit of
              all the social media apps, and I went to the bar near my apartment
              in "downtown" Rochester for the first time in a year for a drink,
              by myself, to celebrate the end of everything and maybe the
              beginning of a lot of things. I've spent most of my college by
              myself, so drinking alone wasn't a big deal to me at all, girl's
              gonna treat herself no matter what you feel me?
            </p>
            <p>
              I was talking to the reddit guy, and told him that I was drinking
              by myself. I did't care if he thought I was weird or a loner. He
              told me that he felt honored or something in the line of that,
              told me to be careful, and told me solemnly that "I'm here". I was
              perplexed for a heartbeat. He seems to really care. I finished my
              drink, was drunk nicely, and walked back to my apartment, all
              whilst texting the reddit guy. I probably should stop calling him
              "the reddit guy" now. His username is Mellow. We said good night
              to each other, and I went back to sleep.
            </p>

              I got the job offer the next day. I was very excited, and accepted
              it the next day. Me and my friends went on our planned trip to
              Boston, one of their houses. We played board games and hang out in
              the basement, visited downtown Boston in the crisp winter air, and
              had great Chinese and Italian and Indian foods. We spent Chirstmas
              together. They welcomed us to their home. We went to see a live
              music from a band they love. It was such a blast. After that, I
              went with my best friend E to her house in another major city. We
              traveled, cooked, had fun, everyday. We really get along. And all
              the mean time, I was talking to Mellow everyday. We talked about
              our days everyday, and I sent him the pictures I took. We listened
              to musics together. We started playing a video game together and
              streaming shows together. I spent the New Years Eve with E but
              also him. He was always responsive, patient and chill.
            </p>
            <p>
              Me and Mellow used reddit as a chat app for 2 months. For the
              first time, I felt safe with someone. I couldn't help but craving
              to spend time with him and maybe see him and become something
              more. I learned a lot about him too. I thought, I should give it a
              try. I already told a few friends that I was gonna go see them
              before my job starts, but I asked Mellow if he would be interested
              in meeting me in his city instead. It took me forever to come up
              with the courage to ask something big like that. It would
              definitely take me sometime to recover if he had said no. To
              express my feelings I even made a playlist. Finally after
              muttering for forever on a call with him, I finally confessed.
              Luckily he reciporcated. Didn't know what's gonna happen, I booked
              the ticket to his nearby city.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              After that everything spiraled. It felt like we've known each
              other for awhile. We became best friends and partners and made
              each other very happy till this day.
            </p>

              After spending 2 months at his parents' house, we moved to San
              Francisco together for my job here. For the first time in my life,
              I was really on my own, financially supporting myself, and have a
              sort of consistent schedule so that I have evenings and weekends
              completely for myself, which unfortunately doesn't mean that I
              still knew how to enjoy my free time. I mostly spent my free time
              with Mellow, was very awkward when I had alone time. On hindsight,
              I realized that I had a lot of trouble switching from being
              stressed and productive to being relaxed and having fun. It was
              okay, except that I was constantly not sure if I was doing "the
              right thing" when I was spending my leisure time, which in turn
              caused me a lot of stress and overthinking. In the mean time, I
              was taking on a lot of responsibilities at work, learning
              speedily, and also slowly realizing that I don't really like this
              job. On the bright side, my company was kinda a big name in the
              startup world for a reason, so I was at least helping out and
              being useful, and I have also gained some experience and
              confidence in programming. On top of all these, I was earning my
              own money. All in all, the majority of the year has kind of a
              similar flavor of sense of lost and self-doubt, unsatisfaction,
              and general productivity and okayness.

              Over the summer and autumn me and Mellow were considering
              marriage. Finally, we had a talk, and I realized that I want the
              security, and on top of everything the togetherness/oneness that
              marraige would bring. So we got married end of September. And I
              can tell you responsibly now that it's one of those happy
              marriages XD I love, love that we are a family now. We are
              literally making so many great memories in an amazing city near
              the sea.

              Beginning of December, I decided to put an end to my mental health
              problems. I started an intensive and comprehensive mental health
              program at UCSF. I was commited. I want to get better. As I look
              inwards more honestly without a lot of judgement, I feel better.
              It was not easy, but it heals me. I had a great Christmas week,
              and am having a very nice New Years week. It was a mix of 60%
              staying at home reading/playing games/watching TV shows, a.k.a
              lazy activities, and 40% housekeeping/paperwork/ self-education
              for a job change. I love the little things that I do that makes me
              feel better, like trying out mindfulness app, new games, certain
              musics, and going to nearby indie coffee shops for delish pastries
              and coffee/tea, and little snacks, and long walks along the water
              to the ferry building. It is bascially what I do before, but more
              fine grained to what I want/need and better pacing. I also give
              myself time to reflect and look inward. It makes me feel grounded
              and have a little bit of clarity, understanding and control over
              myself.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking forward, many challenges lies ahead. For 2023, I want me
              to keep looking inward and be kind to myself and try to tolerate
              stress better, and on the self improvement side try to keep doing
              only a few endeavors instead of jumping from one side hussle to
              another, and focus on depth instead of breath. And of course, I
              will continue cherish the most precious person to me in the world
              Mr. Mellow XD
