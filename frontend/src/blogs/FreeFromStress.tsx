                <p>I care a lot about a lot of things. Relationships, news, my self image -- how I talk to people and how I present myself, 
                what i'm spending time on doing, how I am doing career-wise, stuff like that. It's honestly very stressful. And turns out
                there is no other way to avoid feeling stressed about these things and overthink, than to just simply, let go. </p>
                <p>There is a lot of stress associated with caring so much about so many important things. Personally I'd say it's part of my
                maturing process. It's a very long time ago, but I used to be this procastinating teenager that doesn't get anything done. 
                Everyone around me -- it seems to me -- are very busy, competitive and accomplished. Score is everything to me. My strict
                parent also didn't help a lot. So I became really critical about myself, and towards the end of high school, it reached a
                peak, and I just couldn't keep tolerating and lying to myself that this is okay anymore, and I started actually work really
                hard on stuff. And I got to a TOP 30 US college, which is not excellant but not bad considering my high school GPA. </p>
                <p>I didn't stop there. I challenged myself to take the hardest classes, including CS and honor math classes, and attended clubs
                and socialized too. It was freshmen year, and I was without any support system. Soon, I got burnt out. Except that I didn't realized
                what burnt out was, and just isolated myself from everyone due to self disgust. I was devastated. I was supposed to double major
                in math and cs, but instead I only got a math degree, after 4.5 years of college too. Everytime I got a little bit of energy,
                I spent it on school, and eventually finished with all honor and hard classes and a 3.3 GPA, a thesis and 3 years of research experience,
                which is not bad at all. On the downside, I was constantly extremely stressed out and didn't have a social life until end of college.</p>
                <p>Unconciously, I've always known that this is not sustainable at all. Since the tail of my college year, I've been trying to make
                friends, spend more time with friends and hobbies instead of constantly thinking and caring about everything. Along the way, I've
                met a wonderful person, who have always listened to my thoughts and didn't judge me for it. That helped me a ton. He also really
                knows how to relax and have fun, so I got to learn a bit about that as well, instead of always being tensed up and trying to 
                accomplish things. He really balanced me out. Helped me in other ways too. </p>
                <p>What I've learned from this, is that you can still care about things, but you can manage if and how you care about things.
                From my experience, you don't need to care about most things. And things WILL still work out for you. </p>
                <p>Take work for example. I used to only do personal coding projects so that my resume looks good. My job is programming, and initially
                I struggle to be productive because I have to manage goals to achieve by the end of the day and week. And I still enjoyed the 
                programming part, but it feels very different now that I'm only doing it for fun. In my daily work life, I get to have fun when 
                I'm doing it too. There is no strictly set schedule or plans for me anymore. Simply going through the motion without any purpose
                will just magically work with self-motivation and just a healthy dose of routine. It still feels spontaneous, but I'm still productive,
                if not more productive. You just have to switch your mindset, trust yourself, and do what you are interested in. </p>
                <p>Healing is definitely a continuous process. I made some progress, but I'm still trying to feel even better. Started doing personal coding
                projects for fun again, and walking along the water and playing games mainly in weekdays. I used to really like creative outlets like drawing, 
                so I'm actually going to pick those up again, maybe doing some pixel arts. </p>
                <p>I'm much happier now that I stopped caring so much about the end goals. Life is our own story, and please make it fun and happy :)</p>
                <p>Peace!</p>
